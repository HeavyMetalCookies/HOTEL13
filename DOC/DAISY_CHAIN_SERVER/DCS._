    All the servers have socket connections to each
    other and are used as "raid drive" to keep redundant
    copies of images.

    If you HTTP request to F passes message onto G.
                           G passes message onto H.
                           ETC.

    Eventually message goes full circle.

    When message goes full circle you have a variable
    called "BATON"

    BATON is set to "1" when "F" passes on the message.

    A different server might decide that __IT__ should
    handle the DOWNLOAD. If so, BATON gets set to ZERO.

    When [F] sees that BATON is set to "ZERO" it will
    __ASK__ the other server who set BATON to "0" for
    the latest version of the image.

    Server [F] with copy the image in it's data store,
    then serve it to the user.

    Something similiar can work for uploading as well.

    Because all the servers are keeping socket 
    connections open to each other, it will prevent
    our heroku servers from going to sleep.
